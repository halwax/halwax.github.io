For my day job, I'm a Senior Java Developer and Solution Architect of Valida, an Austrian pension fund. Having worked in Java backend development in the last 12 years, I currently mainly make use of Spring (Boot) and Hibernate. 

### Software Tooling

I like to develop tools to aid in repetitive and tedious taks. Over the years I've written generators and designed corresponding models for insurance service interfaces, persistence layers and reporting runtimes. Another interesting task was to support technical migrations like switching a from an Eclipse OSGI environment to Spring Boot applying scripted refactorings on a large code base. In this context I've been using several open-source projects such as JDT, EMF and Xext for many years.

### Java Script

In the last couple of years I'm getting more and more attracted by the growing JavaScript ecosystem. Specifically frameworks like Vue, React and Angular combined with platforms like NodeJs and Chromium provide new sophisticated and efficient ways to develop software.
