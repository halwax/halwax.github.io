For my day job, I'm a Solution Architect and Senior Java Developer of Valida, an Austrian pension fund.
I'm specialiced in model-driven software development, and have been following and using several open-source Eclipse
Modeling Projects such as EMF and Xext for many years.

In the last couple of years I'm getting more and more attracted by the growing JavaScript ecosystem.
Specifically frameworks like React and platforms like Meteor provide new sophisticated and efficient
ways to develop software.
